# Sales-and-Customers-Analysis
# Introduction
This project demonstrates how to implement two critical business intelligence dashboards — Customer Dashboard and Sales Dashboard — using Tableau. These dashboards are aimed at providing actionable insights into customer behavior, sales performance, and business trends for stakeholders, managers, and decision-makers in a business context. The implementation follows a structured approach to ensure that the insights are meaningful and tailored to the needs of the end-users.

The project outlines the key phases of a Tableau implementation, including understanding user requirements, preparing data, creating visualizations, and designing the final dashboards. The objective of these dashboards is to offer a detailed overview of customer interactions and sales trends for 2023, compared to 2022.

# Methodology
The methodology used in this project follows the guidelines shared in a video by Baraa, a Tableau expert, who emphasizes the importance of a step-by-step approach when implementing Tableau projects in large companies. The phases involved in developing the dashboards include:

Understanding User Requirements: The goal of this project was to deliver insights into customer metrics and sales performance. These insights are critical for business managers to analyze trends and take data-driven decisions. To meet these objectives, two distinct dashboards were designed:

A Customer Dashboard, focused on customer distribution, sales per customer, and total orders.
A Sales Dashboard, concentrating on sales performance, profit margins, and quantity of orders.
Preparing the Data Source: The datasets for sales, profit, and customer metrics were imported and processed in Tableau. Data preparation involved connecting to the data sources, creating calculated fields, and understanding the structure of the dataset to ensure correct and relevant data points for visualization.

Building the Visualizations: Each dashboard features multiple visualizations that present the data in a clear and actionable manner. Chart types such as line charts, bar charts, and histograms were used to present the sales, profit, and customer metrics.

Line Charts show monthly trends in total sales, profit, and customer orders for 2023, with comparisons to the previous year (2022).
Bar Charts provide insights into customer distribution and sales by subcategories, ranked by performance and profit margins.
Histograms visualize the number of customer orders in each distribution range.
Planning Dashboard Containers: The dashboard layout was planned by defining containers for each visual element, ensuring a clean and structured presentation. The layout allows for easy navigation between the two dashboards with buttons for switching views.

Building and Designing the Dashboards: The final dashboards were built by adding filters, interactivity, and design elements such as icons, labels, and color-coding to highlight the highest and lowest values. Interactivity was achieved using filters that allow users to dynamically switch between different views and time periods.

# Dashboard Overview
# Customer Dashboard
The Customer Dashboard presents an overview of key customer metrics, including:

Total Customers: Shows the number of customers in 2023 (693), with an 8.6% increase compared to the previous year.
Total Sales per Customer: Provides insight into the average sales per customer ($221.4), which is a 5.99% decrease from 2022.
Total Orders: Displays the total number of orders (1,687), representing a 28.29% increase compared to 2022.
Customer Distribution by Number of Orders: A bar chart illustrates the distribution of customers based on the number of orders, with most customers placing 1–3 orders.
The dashboard includes a ranked list of customers by sales and profit, with names, last order dates, and total profit generated.

# Sales Dashboard
The Sales Dashboard focuses on sales performance metrics, showing:

Total Sales: Sales of $733K for 2023, an increase of 20.4% compared to 2022.
Total Profit: Profit generated is $93K, a 14.24% increase from the previous year.
Total Quantity: 12K units were sold, a 26.83% increase compared to 2022.
Additionally, the dashboard includes:

Sales & Profit Trends Over Time: Line charts showing sales and profit trends, highlighting where 2023 values are above or below the average.
Sales & Profit by Subcategory: A detailed view of how different subcategories of products performed in terms of sales and profit, comparing 2023 to 2022 values. Items like phones, chairs, and binders performed exceptionally well, with significant profit margins, while others showed losses.
# Conclusion
This project demonstrates how Tableau can be used to build professional, actionable dashboards that meet the requirements of various business stakeholders. By using a structured approach, we were able to create two dashboards that provide critical insights into customer behavior and sales performance.

The dashboards offer a clear view of trends, with comparisons to previous years, helping managers understand where the business is excelling and where there is room for improvement. The use of interactive filters and clear visualizations ensures that the data is accessible and actionable for decision-making.

This approach can be applied to various other Tableau projects, ensuring that data is presented in a user-friendly and insightful manner
